##PHP MVC Light Framework

MVC Light is a light weight and most basic framework for develop web applications. Developing a web application from cratch is quite a pain of handling routing etc. MVC light attempts to take the pain of those stuff. There are much to improve this, but wanted to give the user freedom of developing it to their requirements.

##Requirements

PHP 5.3 or greater is required.

Although a database is not a required to use this framework, If a database is to be used, framework is designed to work with MySQL and PDO. By altering a little, you can make it to work with any other database too.

##Installation

1. Download the framework
2. Unzip and upload to your server so that index.php, mc-autoload.php and mc-config.php files are in the root.
3. Open mc-config.php file and do the required modifications to the constants. SITE_URL is to be '/' if the site is on root. If it is on a sub-directory, use sub-directory name as the SITE_URL

That's it. You are ready to go.
